# Usage
We describe two case studies for JGEA, each aimed at testing different, and possibly contrasting, aspects and features of the framework.
The first case study covers the requirements of ease of use and solidity for end users of an EC framework.
In particular, said users might want to adopt EC to solve newly defined problems, even combining the EC framework with external software.
The second case study, instead, deals with the extensibility of JGEA.
This case study examines the needs of researchers in the field of EC, who would want to add new algorithms without implementing everything from scratch, being able to test them right away on domain-appropriate benchmarks.

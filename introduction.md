{: .no_toc }

Whenever researchers approach the field of Evolutionary Computation (EC), they soon come across the struggle of choosing a software system to experiment with.
In the absence of ingrained research group practices, newbies might feel lost trying to navigate the maze of available EC frameworks.
Even the Google Search Engine-the wise old man of the game-seems at a loss: when asked about the "best software for evolutionary computation" it prompts a mixture of rather vague and confusing results, spanning across the most exotic programming languages.
Not to mention the 7000 repositories returned by querying Github with the word "evolutionary".
